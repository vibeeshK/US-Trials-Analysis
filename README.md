# US-Trials-Analysis

In this project, we are tasked to work like an analyst to find out which features or activities are a part of the best trails in the USA. I decided that the popularity and average rating were the main factors that determined how good the trails are. I made a ranked list of most frequently occurring features and activities occurring only in the top 90 percentile of popularity and average rating. But before that, I did some analysis to check if there were other variables that had an effect on the popularity.
